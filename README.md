DNA Methylation Plot Tool
=====================================
This tool is written in C#

It will read one/multiple vectors of bins with methylation reads and visualized it with light and dark color.

Each vectors should have the same length for visualization, maximunly support 10 replicates.

Used in the paper:

BIMMER: a novel algorithm for detecting differential DNA methylation regions from MBDCap-seq data

BIMMER: A Bi-layer hidden Markov model for differential methylation analysis
